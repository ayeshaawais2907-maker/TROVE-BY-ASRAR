  <h2>🌿 OUR STORY</h2>

<p>Trove by Asrar began with a simple idea —
to create small treasures that bring joy into everyday life.<br><br>

What started as a hobby at a tiny desk, surrounded by beads, charms, and sketches, slowly grew into something more meaningful. 
Each piece was designed with care, and every sparkly accessory held a little bit of love, personality, and imagination.<br><br>

Asrar believed that the right accessory can change the whole way you feel about your day —
make you smile, add confidence, or remind you of something beautiful.<br><br>

With every bracelet threaded, every earring assembled, and every charm polished by hand, Trove by Asrar found its purpose:<br>
to make affordable, handmade accessories that feel special, personal, and one of a kind.<br><br>

Today, Trove by Asrar continues to grow, but the heart remains the same —
to craft pieces that tell stories, celebrate individuality, and remind you that beauty lies in the little things.<br><br>

Whether you’re treating yourself or gifting a friend, we hope our creations bring a spark of happiness to your world 🌸💛</p>
